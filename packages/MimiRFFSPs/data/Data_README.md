# MimiRFFSPs Data README

This file describes all files held within the `data` folder of the `MimiRFFSPs` repository.

## 1990 Population

_population1990.csv_

In order to run some damage functions we need the baseline population from 1990.  To obtain this, we use population values obtained from the UN's World Population Prospects, 2019 revision: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/. These they can be downloaded in the form of Excel spreadsheets.

## Keys

This file holds the specifc 184 country alphanumeric and numeric codes for the ISO3 countries avaiable in the RFF SP projections. These are a subset of the ISO3116-1 codes in the files above, and should map one-to-one for those available.
